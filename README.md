# RESTful API
Useful information on building and consuming REST Services

<h2>What is REST?</h2>

<strong>RESTful API or REST API</strong> stands for REpresentational State Transfer. It was defined by Dr. Roy Fielding in his 2000 doctorate dissertation.
REST is Resource Based meaning<br>
<blockquote>The fundamental concept in any RESTful API is the resource. A resource is an object with a type, associated data, relationships to other resources, and a set of methods that operate on it. It is similar to an object instance in an object-oriented programming language, with the important difference that only a few standard methods are defined for the resource (corresponding to the standard HTTP GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods), while an object instance typically has many methods - REST API Design website</blockquote>
